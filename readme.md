# Luckypot

Another pygame engine. It might be what you need, if you're lucky to be called Diego.

Seriously, you probably don't want to use this engine.
It is not stable (and I don't have plans to make it stable yet) and there are many things hardcoded for my own needs.
If you do use it, take one of those 3 options, by order of preference:
1. Copy the code and adapt it to your needs.
2. Fork it and adapt it to your needs.
3. Pin the library to a specific version, and use it as is.

There's no documentation, but the code has reasonably good docstrings.
You can also check the examples in the `examples` folder, and run them with
`python -m luckypot.examples`.
