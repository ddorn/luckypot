# Luckypot

Another pygame engine. It might be what you need, if you're lucky to be called Diego.

Seriously, you probably don't want to use this engine, but if you do, pin it to a specific version, 
as it's not stable, and I don't have plans to make it stable yet.
The best use is probably to fork it, as many things are hardcoded for my own needs.

There's no documentation, but the code has reasonably good docstrings.
You can also check the examples in the `examples` folder, and run them with 
`python -m luckypot.examples.example_name`.
